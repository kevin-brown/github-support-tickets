# Unofficial GitHub Support Ticket Tracker

GitHub doesn't have a way to view past support tickets, or see what the results were, so this repository was created to track them.  It's mostly for personal use, to keep track of tickets which I have sent in, but it may also be useful if you need to track the status of a ticket that was submitted.
